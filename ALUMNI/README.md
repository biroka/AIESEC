# AIESEC Internship Program
Since 2013 we've been partnering with AIESEC to offer undergraduates and master's degree students the chance to do 6-12 month developmental internships at our corporate divisions around the world. AIESEC interns enjoy real experience on complex projects (both manual testing, test automation as well as software development), and the chance to gain the sort of skills required by global organizations and customers from Japan, Finland, USA, Luxemburg, Germany.
